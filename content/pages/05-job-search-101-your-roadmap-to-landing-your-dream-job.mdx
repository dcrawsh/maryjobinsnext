## <span id="understanding-your-strengths-self-assessment">Understanding Your Strengths: Self-Assessment</span>

Before embarking on your job search, it's crucial to understand your skills, experience, and career aspirations.  What are you passionate about? What unique talents do you offer? Reflect on your past accomplishments and consider taking a skills assessment to identify your strengths. This self-awareness will make your job search more focused and efficient.  Knowing your strengths allows you to target roles that are a perfect fit for your abilities and interests.


## <span id="crafting-a-winning-resume-and-cover-letter">Crafting a Winning Resume and Cover Letter</span>

Your resume and cover letter are your first impressions – make them count! A well-crafted resume highlights your accomplishments and skills using strong action verbs and quantifiable results. Your cover letter should tailor your experience to each specific job, showcasing your enthusiasm and qualifications. MaryJobins offers a resume upload feature to help you easily manage and organize your application materials.

**Tips for a Stellar Resume:**

* Use action verbs (e.g., "managed," "developed," "implemented") to describe your accomplishments.
* Quantify your achievements with numbers and data (e.g., "increased sales by 15%," "managed a team of 5").
* Tailor your resume to each job application, highlighting the skills and experience most relevant to the specific role.
* Keep it concise, easy to read, and visually appealing, typically aiming for one page for recent graduates and those with less than 10 years of experience.

**Example:** Instead of "Managed social media," try "Increased social media engagement by 25% in six months, resulting in a 10% increase in leads."
