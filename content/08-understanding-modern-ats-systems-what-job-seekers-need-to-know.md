    Understanding Modern ATS Systems: What Job Seekers Need to Know
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Finding your dream job can be a challenging process. However, a strategic approach can significantly improve your chances—especially when you grasp how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) work. Let’s explore these digital gatekeepers and learn how to ensure your application lands in front of a human recruiter.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    What Are Applicant Tracking Systems?
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    ATS are software platforms used by most companies to manage large volumes of applications. Acting like digital assistants, they scan resumes and cover letters for keywords that match job descriptions. Candidates with the highest keyword matches get routed to recruiters, while others may be filtered out automatically.

    How ATS Impacts Your Application
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    If your documents aren’t ATS-friendly, they might never reach a hiring manager. ATS algorithms assign a score based on keyword relevance and formatting. A low score means your resume could be overlooked—no matter how strong your experience.
  </p>

  <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mb-6 overflow-x-auto">

// Simplified ATS flow:
// 1. Submission → 2. Keyword scan → 3. Scoring → 4. Recruiter review (if score ≥ threshold)
</code>
  </pre>

    Optimizing Your Resume & Cover Letter for ATS Success
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>
      <strong>Keyword Optimization:</strong> Review the job description and integrate relevant terms (e.g., “project management,” “budget analysis”) naturally into your resume and cover letter.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Formatting Best Practices:</strong> Use standard fonts (Arial, Times New Roman), simple layouts, and save as .docx—many ATS struggle with PDFs, tables, and graphics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resume Structure:</strong> Employ clear headings and bullet points. Highlight achievements with action verbs and quantifiable results (e.g., “Increased customer satisfaction by 15%”).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cover Letter Tips:</strong> Tailor each letter to the role, weave in keywords, and demonstrate impact (e.g., “I boosted retention by 20% through improved communication”).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
    Common ATS Mistakes to Avoid
  </h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Avoid overly creative formatting—simplicity is key.</li>
    <li>Don’t neglect keyword research—missing terms mean lower scores.</li>
    <li>Resist submitting PDFs—choose .docx for better parsing.</li>
    <li>Never use a one-size-fits-all resume—customize for each application.</li>
    <li>Ensure consistency—mismatched dates or titles can confuse the ATS.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">
