    <li>
      <strong>Upload & Initial Processing:</strong> Upload your resume (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and our system converts it into a structured format for AI analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:</strong> We address formatting inconsistencies and use OCR for scanned documents, ensuring clean, accurate data across all file types.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Skill Extraction & Categorization:</strong> Advanced NLP techniques—such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech tagging—extract and categorize both hard skills (e.g., “Python programming”) and soft skills (e.g., “communication”).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Matching with Open Positions:</strong> Our algorithms compare your extracted profile against open roles in our database to generate highly relevant job recommendations.
